### egoist/vue-timeago
This project is heavily inspired by [egoist](https://github.com/egoist)'s [vue-timeago](https://github.com/egoist/vue-timeago), a timeago plugin for Vue.js v2. Sadly he isn't maintaining the project anymore. So.. here we are! :)

### date-fns
Having the ``defaultConverter`` based on [date-fns](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns) basically means that the whole library is based on date-fns. So cheers to you guys! Thanks for your awesome framework.
